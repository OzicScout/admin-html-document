<p style="font-size:50px;">How to moderate on the Legacy SMP for dum dums!</p>
<p style="font-size:30px;"> (Jk jk everyone can learn!!)<br>
    Sorry this is so basic, I wanted to make it easy for everyone to read! (And quite frankly can't be bothered to bring out the full nerd for this ðŸ˜­) </p>

    <p style="font-size:55px;">--------------------------------------------------</p>

    <p style="font-size:55px;">
        Alright, first up, <u>Mods!</u>
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:30px;"> 
        As you probably already know, you <u>have less permissions that Admins</u><br>
        That doesn't matter though! You can still be amazing at keeping the server at peace!<br></p>
        <p style="font-size:55px;">--------------------------------------------------</p>
        <p style="font-size:30px;">
        </p>
    </br>
    <p style="font-size:40px;px;">
    First, lets go over ledger.</p><br>
    <p style="font-size:30px;"> Ledger is our new replacement for Co-Inspect. As we are on fabric, without plugins, this was our best choice. Now yes, it <u>different than Co-Inspect</u>, however, if you can get quite good with it, its actually more useful!</u><br>
    Ledger is started by using "/ledger" in-game. After that you will find a range of commands, that you may see are similar to Co-Inspect, just worded differently. These commands consist of:
    <ul style="font-size:30px;">
        - /ledger i (which is the same as /ledger inspect)<br>
        - /legder search
        - /ledger rollback
        - /ledger restore
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:30px;">
        Now, there are some more legder commands in game, however, they are unimportant to us<br>
        In this document I will cover how to use the important ones listed<br>
        Lets first do: <b>/ledger i</b><br>
        /ledger i, (also know as /legder inspect) is the same as /co-inspect on the last/first SMP!<br>
        All you have to do is: enable <b>/ledger i</b> in game, then, punch (left click) your desired block/entity and you will be able see all logs you need to sort an issue!<br>
        <br>
        Next let's go over: /ledger search<br>
        /ledger search is the legder equivalent of /co lookup from the last/first SMP!<br>
        You can search items, blocks, actions, players, etc.<br>
        To see if a player, for say, stole and item, you would use the command:<br>
        <b>/ledger search source:[player name] action:[item-remove] after:[after an amount of time, if you want to search a large amount, I suggest 2weeks] range:[amout of blocks, or if you want global, @global]</b>
        This would show you where, and when they stole/or removed a specific item, [if you use: object:specific item wanted] after the action.<br>
        Or if you just want to see what a player has done in a specific amount of time, but without a specific action, you can just use: <br>
        <b>/ledger search source:[player name] after:[amount of time]</b><br>
        <br>
        Next up, /ledger rollback<br>
        As suggested in the name, /legder rollback is the same as /co rollback from the last/1st SMP!<br>
        Let's say you wanted to rollback a stealer, you would suggestively use the following command:<br>
        <b>/ledger rollback source:[player name] action:[item-remove] after:[amount of time] range:[amount of blocks, or if you want global, @global</b><br>
        You can customise these values to your situation, much like you can in /ledger search <br>
        <br>
        And finally, /ledger restore <br>
        /legder restore is the same as /co undo from the last/1st SMP, howvever it is mainly for rollbacks. It undos a rollback that you did. <br>
        Lets say that you falsely rollback somebody, and needed to undo that, you would: <br>
        b>/ledger restore source:[player name] action:[item-remove] after:[amount of time] range:[amount of blocks, or if you want global, @global</b><br>
        As said in the last 2 commands, you can customise these values to your situation. The values should <b>match</b> whatever rollback you're <br>
        Thats all you need to know for ledger to handle issues containing stealing, missing blocks, etc. <br>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:40px;px;">Next, let's go over banning people</p><br>
        <p style="font-size:30px;">
        So, somebody is breaking the rules, but, do you ban them? Well, let's go over the conditions, with a few examples <br>
        <br></p>
        <p style="font-size:40px;px;">
            Example 1: Somebody has stolen a few items, which consist of:
            <ul style="font-size:30px;">
                - 47 dirt
                - 2 oak saplings
                - A stack of gravel
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:30px;">
            Do you ban them for this?<br>
            If you answered yes, you are WRONG! For small, "useless" items like this, you do NOT ban them. A mild, OR final warning, (in which meanings can be found in #SMP-Warnings) would be a sensible response to this situation. <br>
            Now, still on the topic of stealing, let's say somebody stole items consisting of:
            <ul style="font-size:30px;">
                - An enchanted book
                - A stack of cobblestone (x7)
                - A range of <b>valueable</b> items to a player
            </ul>
            NOW do you ban them for this?
            If you answered yes this time, you are correct! Items of this value to a player being stolen would be a permanent ban, with no appeal avaialable!
